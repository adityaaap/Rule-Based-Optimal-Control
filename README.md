# Rule-Based-Optimal-Control
Project implements an approach for Autonomous Vehicle to navigate on the road using an optimal control technique. In this technique the constraints (Traffic Rules/Obstacles/Driving behavior) are given an priority order. The constraints are relaxed based on their priority to find the optimal trajectory.
